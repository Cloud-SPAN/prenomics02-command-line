Command line interface (OS shell) and graphic user interface (GUI) are different ways of interacting with a computer's operating system. The shell is a program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.

A lot of genomics analysis is done using command-line tools for three reasons:   

- you will often be working with a large number of files, and working through the command-line rather than 
through a graphical user interface (GUI) allows you to automate repetitive tasks,    
- you will often need more compute power than is available on your personal computer, and 
connecting to and interacting with remote computers requires a command-line interface, and    
- you will often need to customize your analyses, and command-line tools often enable more 
customization than the corresponding GUI tools (if in fact a GUI tool even exists).   


> ## Getting Started
>
> This lesson assumes no prior experience with the tools covered in the module. 
> However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts,
> including the concept of genomic variation within a population. 
> 
> Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. 
>
> This lesson uses an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI). If you are attending a tutor-led workshop your AMI will be created for you and will be sent the log in information you will need for this lesson. If you are self-studying Prenomics, you will need to set up your own instance using our [Create Your Own AWS Instance module](https://cloud-span.github.io/create-aws-instance-0-overview/).
> 
> Before starting this lesson, you should go through the [Files and Directories](https://cloud-span.github.io/prenomics01-file-directories/) lesson.
