# Prenomics Session 2. Using the command line

## Overview of the Cloud-SPAN Prenomics module.

Cloud-SPAN is a collaboration between the [Department of Biology, University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/) and [The Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) funded by the UKRI innovation scholars award (Project Reference: [MR/V038680/1](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgtr.ukri.org%2Fprojects%3Fref%3DMR%252FV038680%252F1&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF0nsozFp-1kvcp0Dgjks6kY8CiCQ)) which trains researchers, and the research software engineers that support them, to run specialised analyses on cloud-based high-performance computing infrastructure

The Prenomics module is designed to prepare people for the [Cloud-SPAN Genomics module](https://cloud-span.github.io/00genomics/) . We have found that people taking the Genomics module can vary the amount of experience they have had in navigating file systems and using the command line. We have designed the Prenomics module to allow more time for those with less experience to cover some foundation concepts. We have a [Self-assessment Quiz](https://shiny.york.ac.uk/er13/prenomics-quiz/#section-why) to help you decide if you would benefit from attending Prenomics before the Genomics module.

The Prenomics and Genomics modules are based on the Data Carpentry's [Genomics Workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/).

Prenomics teaches the basics of command-line programming, including: (1) file directory structure, (2) use of command-line utilities to connect to and use cloud computing and storage resources and (3) basic shell commands for file navigation and basic script writing.

The module is designed for a two half-day, tutor-led workshop, or for self study.

The prenomics module comprises 3 GitHub repositories:
